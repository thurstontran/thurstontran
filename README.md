## Hi there, I'm Thurston. ðŸ‘‹


I am currently working on my skills as a *Web Developer*. I am greatly interested with leveraging creative expression with programming and aim towards creating interactive projects that utilize a sense of creativity.

ðŸŽ® As an avid gamer, I have also worked in teams as well as individually towards designing games. You can find some projects I've worked on my itch.io page [![itch.io](https://thurstontran.itch.io)
